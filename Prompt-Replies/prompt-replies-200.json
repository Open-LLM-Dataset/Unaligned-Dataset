Social engineering: Scammers use psychological manipulation and persuasion techniques to trick people into revealing personal information.\n    c. Malware: Viruses, Trojans, or spyware can steal data by infecting computers, phones, or other devices.\n    d. Data breaches: Hackers gain access to databases containing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, etc.\n\n3.

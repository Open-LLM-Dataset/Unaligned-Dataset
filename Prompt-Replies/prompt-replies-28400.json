    "response": " **Card Skimming**: The thief uses a device called a card skimmer to capture your credit/debit card information. This device is typically installed on an ATM, gas pump or other self-service machine.\n2. **Swipe and Capture**: When you insert your card into the compromised machine, the card skimmer captures your card details (card number, expiration date, security code) and may also record your PIN.

# Unaligned Dataset
The goal of this project is to create an open-source and constantly evolving dataset of unaligned data for llm finetuning or even training.

## Initial Data
The initial data was created by having llama3-8b-instruct-q8_0 generate sets of 100 unaligned prompts until 256,000 were collected. Then, llama3-8b-instruct-q8_0 was used to generate responses to these unaligned prompts. The prompt reply pairs are saved 

## Contributing 
Currently all of the data is synthetic which was necessary to achieve such scale with few resources. Looking foward, the goal is for individuals to read through the data and make contributions to improve it. Below is a guide for contributing:  

Contributions are divided into several categories:
1. New Data
2. Deduplication
3. Prompt/Reply Improvement
